'''
Take the code from the How To Decode A Website exercise
(if you didn’t do it or just want to play with some different code,
use the code from the solution), and instead of printing the results
to a screen, write the results to a txt file. In your code, just make up a
name for the file you are saving to.

Extras:

Ask the user to specify the name of the output file that will be saved.
